## Process:
- Started out as a drawing.
- Placed the image in adobe illustrator and traced using the pen tool.
- Deleted drawing and made adjustments and simplfied and grouped the paths to make design more minimal and allow fill for colors.
- Created circles to encapsulate the drawing and create more objects
- Each one teach one title is intended to follow through from the bottom of the hand through the circles and ending on the last.
- Used svgomg to optimize image
- Saved document and opened svg coding and pasted into github file
